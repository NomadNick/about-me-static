    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am an <b>aspiring software developer</b>, focused on learning and honing skills each day.

For enjoyment, I love to get out and <b>enjoy the outdoors</b> and go for hikes, and BBQ with friends.</p>
    <p>What's important to me is leading <b>a happy and fulfilling life</b> that allows me to realize personal goals and also <b>give back to others</b> who find value in my experience.</p>

    <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
    <p>I tend towards <b>electronic music</b>, preferably without lyrics. It helps me retain focus and keep energy high while learning and working.</p>
